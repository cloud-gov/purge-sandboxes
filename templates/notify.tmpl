{{define "content"}}
  <p>You're receiving this message because you have content in a cloud.gov sandbox that is approaching {{.days}} days old.</p>

<p>
  We clear all sandbox content {{.days}} days after the first application or service is created to ensure that sandboxes aren't being used for production applications.
  You may re-deploy your application(s) after your sandbox is cleared and continue to evaluate whether cloud.gov is a good fit for your needs.
  <a href="https://cloud.gov/docs/pricing/free-limited-sandbox/">Learn more about policies for sandbox usage</a>.
</p>


<ul>
  <li>
    On {{.date.Format "Jan 02, 2006"}}, we'll delete all applications, service instances, routes, etc., in the {{.org.Name}}/{{.space.Name}} space.
  </li>
  <li>
    Deleting the content of the sandbox resets the clock; you can start a new {{.days}}-day evaluation period just by creating a new app or service
    instance in the empty space.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We hope you've found the sandbox helpful.
If you'd like to host longer-lived content on cloud.gov, you'll need to do it as part of a <a href="https://cloud.gov/pricing">prototyping or production package</a>.
Please <a href="https://cloud.gov/docs/help/">contact us</a> to learn how to purchase one of these packages.</p>
